# CityIQ Python Starter Code

This starter code written with python3 is meant to demonstrate how to get events using the REST API (demo.py) and the WebSocket (demoWebsocket.py).  
All REST queries are made using the cityiq.py script.

NOTE: please make sure to fill credentials.py with your credential information

To run, simply navigate to this directory via your terminal and run the following command:
$ python3 demo.py

To connect to the websocket using python, after importing the relevant pip3 packages, run the following command:
$ python3 demoWebsocket.py
